# The travis-ci servers are going to run this script on any push
# to the repo. Basically, it
# - tells the author of a commit if his commit has broken the build,
# - deploys two .zip containing the linux and osx apps, with the
#   touist compiled in it
#
# vim:set et sw=2 ts=2:
language: c
sudo: required
script: bash -ex .travis-ci.sh
env:
  - OCAML_VERSION=4.01.0 OPAM_VERSION=1.0.0
# The commiter will be informed that one of his commits
# broke the build. I didn't want us to receive an email
# each time we did a new branch, so I changed to 
#     on_success: never
notifications:
  email:
    on_success: never # default: change
    on_failure: always # default: always
